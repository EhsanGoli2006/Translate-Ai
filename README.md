## OpenAI Translation Extension

The extension uses the OpenAI API for translating texts. Therefore, you need to generate a token to use the extension.

### Step 1: Creating an API in OpenAI:

1. Log in to your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or [create a new account](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. After logging in, navigate to the "APIs" section or similar.
3. Create a new instance of API with the name "Translation API" or a custom name.
4. Retrieve necessary information such as the API key. Save this API key as you'll need it to connect to the OpenAI API within your extension.

### Step 2: Adding the API Token to the Extension:

1. After obtaining the OpenAI API key, place this key within your extension. Use a form in the toolbar for entering the API token.
